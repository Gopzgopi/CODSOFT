## 1️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection  
### 📌 Objective  
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.

### 📂 Dataset  
- **File:** `credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv`
- Contains transaction details with labeled fraud instances.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  

### 🔍 Features  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Fraud transaction prediction  

### 📌 How to Run  
1. Load `credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv`  
2. Train the model or load `credit_card_fraud_model.pkl`  
3. Input transaction data and get fraud prediction

## 2️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction  
### 📌 Objective  
Predicting customer churn helps businesses retain valuable customers.

### 📂 Dataset  
- **File:** `customer_churn_dataset.csv`
- Includes customer subscription details and churn status.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  

### 🔍 Features  
- Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)  
- Model training and performance evaluation  
- Churn prediction  

### 📌 How to Run  
1. Load `customer_churn_dataset.csv`  
2. Train the model or use `churn_prediction_model.pkl`  
3. Input customer details and get churn prediction

## 3️⃣ Spam SMS Detection  
### 📌 Objective  
Classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham** using NLP techniques.

### 📂 Dataset  
- **File:** `spam_dataset.csv`
- Contains SMS text messages labeled as spam or ham.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn  
- Machine Learning: Logistic Regression  

### 🔍 Features  
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization)  
- Model training and performance analysis  
- SMS classification  

### 📌 How to Run  
1. Load `spam_dataset.csv`  
2. Train the model or use `logistic_regression_classifier.pkl`  
3. Input SMS text and classify it as spam or ham
